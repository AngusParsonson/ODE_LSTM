Although an LSTM is being used, the benefits of using an LSTM are not being
exploited because only a snapshot of the current state of the market is
inputted - as opposed to a sequential series of market data.

Was that the final version of Matt's thesis?

Will I be able to use the new concurrent version of BSE?
Is that in Python 3? (noticed Aaron stuck with Python 2.7)

Noticed DeepLOB used LSE for training and testing, could this be possible for 
DeepTrader?

Papers looked over talk about time-series prediction, is DeepTrader a
time-series prediction or does it just spit out a price based on the LOB?

Would it be possible to try and train deeptrader to choose its own limit price?
(e.g. training it to predict a price and enter when profit forseen?)

What stuff should I talk about in my critical evaluation section?
- Not much apart from testing metrics, tradeoffs made in design?

Is the page limit on each section a strict guideline?
- Covered the majority of project execution quickly.
- How much is there to talk about neural network architecture?
- Aaron seemed not to write much for this section.
